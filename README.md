# hl2-extended-fire
(Half-Life 2) Code snippets that 1) allow flares to provide heat to fires, and fire sensors to sense all flares and env_firesource entities; 2) add ignite sound and loop sound functions to env_fires.

Included are: 
* Valve's fire.cpp/h, props.cpp, weapon_flaregun.cpp/h with my edits.
* Edited FGD entries for env_fire, env_firesensor, and env_flare.
* Example BSP/VMF with the entities in place.

# Credits:
* Valve Software: original fire.cpp/h, props.cpp, weapon_flaregun.cpp/h, assets used in the example map.
* Cvoxalury: the code edits.
